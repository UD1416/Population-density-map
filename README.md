# Population-density-map

Population density map is a different method on synthesizing site analysis to make informed decisions in a complex, informal and dense urban environment commonly found in South Asian cities. 

The analysis period has been based on an approximation made on site observation. 

The map divides into two broad categories which are Resident and Floating. 

These are simply to see what amount of the site remains as populated and to relate it to the activities, uses and typology over the given set.

Jamalpur has dense populated residential areas and with a major portion of it’s commercial grouped into the southern sector.  

The population density is around 9,900 people per square kilometer or around 26,000 per square mile. The city has grown by about one and a half million people by the last census in 2011. A nearby military base and government institutions bring people from all over India to Ahmedabad and fuel city growth. By 2021, there could be nearly 9 million people residing in Ahmedabad. 

These population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects. 

These estimates represent the Urban agglomeration of Ahmedabad, which typically includes Ahmedabad’s population in addition to adjacent suburban areas.

Ahmedabad 2017 - 26,000 persons/Km2 2020 - 40,000 persons/Km2 Current population - 8,019,000 
Projected population - 9,010,000 Projections averaged from census and growth rate at 0.32% p.a
